Little trial code as an interview filter from 1QBits

Task:
	Create a function, ideally in python, which takes in a string S and 
	returns an array of substrings of S. The substrings returned must be
	contiguous parts of S with the following condition: Each substring 
	must be the only entry containg a given letter and you should make as
	many substrings as possilbe.
	
	So for S = "test" the substring array is ["test"] but for S = "testing" 
	the substrings are ["test", "i", "n", "g"]
